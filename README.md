I have made a project that is only for online Banking System.
Python Banking System:
This Python banking system provides a simple interface for users to perform basic banking operations such as depositing money, withdrawing money, checking balance, and more. It also includes a feature for users to change their passwords with OTP (One Time Password) verification.
Features:
User Authentication: Users can authenticate themselves with their passwords before performing any banking operation.
Deposit: Users can deposit money into their accounts.
Withdraw: Users can withdraw money from their accounts, provided they have sufficient balance.
Balance Inquiry: Users can check their account balance.
Display Information: Users can view their account information.
Password Change with OTP: Users can change their passwords by verifying with OTP.
git clone https://github.com/your-username/banking-system.git
Usage
Upon running the script, users will be prompted to enter their username, account ID, phone number, and password to create an account.
After account creation, users can choose from the menu options to perform various banking operations.
Users must authenticate themselves with their passwords before executing any operation.
Option 6 allows users to change their passwords by verifying with OTP.
Requirements
Python 3.x
